# 💰 Expense Tracker

A centralized expense tracking platform that helps users manage their finances efficiently by collecting, categorizing, and visualizing expenses in a single dashboard. The system is designed to be simple, transparent, and scalable for future enhancements.

## 📌 Project Description

Managing expenses across multiple payment apps and platforms can be confusing. This project aims to solve that problem by providing a unified expense management system where users can track income, expenses, and spending patterns easily.
The platform allows users to securely log in, record transactions, categorize expenses (such as rent, food, travel, subscriptions, and debt), and view detailed insights through visual dashboards.
An OCR (Optical Character Recognition) feature is planned to automatically extract text from receipt images, enabling faster and more accurate expense entry.

## ⭐ How This Project Is Different From Others

- **Centralized View:** Unlike many expense trackers that focus on a single payment method, this platform is designed to combine expenses from multiple sources into one unified dashboard.
- **Simplicity First:** Most existing applications offer too many complex features. This project prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and a clean user interface.
- **Source-Based Tracking:** Users can identify which app or payment method was used for each transaction, improving transparency.
- **Scalable Design:** Built with future growth in mind, allowing easy integration of automation, analytics, and mobile support.
- **OCR Integration:** Planned receipt scanning reduces manual effort and minimizes data entry errors.
- **Student-Friendly:** Lightweight and easy to understand, making it ideal for students and individual users.
